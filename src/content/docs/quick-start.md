# Quick Start Guide

Getting started with Stratum is simple. Follow these three steps to begin your first security audit.

## 1. Create your Account

Head over to [app.stratum.so/signup](https://app.stratum.so/signup) to create your workspace. Once your email is verified, you'll be redirected to the Stratum Dashboard.

## 2. Connect your Infrastructure

Stratum supports multiple ways to monitor your assets:

- **Cloud Connectors**: Securely link your AWS, Azure, or GCP accounts using read-only IAM roles.
- **Domain Discovery**: Simply enter your root domain (e.g., `company.com`) and Stratum will automatically map your subdomains and IP ranges.
- **IP Ranges**: Manually add CIDR blocks for targeted scanning.

## 3. Run your First Scan

Navigate to the **Scanners** tab in your dashboard:
1. Select the **Target** you just added.
2. Choose a **Scan Profile** (e.g., "Full Infrastructure Audit" or "Fast Vulnerability Check").
3. Click **Launch Scan**.

The results will begin appearing in real-time on your **Vulnerability Map**.
