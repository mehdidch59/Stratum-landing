# Introduction

Stratum is a cloud-native security orchestration platform designed to give you full visibility into your infrastructure without the overhead of manual configuration.

As a **SaaS application**, Stratum requires zero local installation. Everything is managed through our cloud dashboard, allowing you to connect your infrastructure and start scanning in minutes.

## Key Principles

- **Zero-Trust Infrastructure**: We scan from external vantage points to see what attackers see.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Security isn't a one-time event; it's a constant stream of data.
- **Actionable Insights**: We don't just find vulnerabilities; we provide the exact steps to fix them.

## Why Stratum?

Unlike traditional security tools that require complex agents or local binaries, Stratum operates entirely in the cloud. You connect your cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) or point us to your domains, and we handle the rest.
